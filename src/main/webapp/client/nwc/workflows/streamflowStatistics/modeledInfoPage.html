    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Effective and responsible management of water resources relies on a thorough
        understanding of the quantity and quality of available water. Streamgages
        cannot be installed at every location where streamflow information is needed.
        As part of its National Water Census, the U.S. Geological Survey is planning
        to provide streamflow estimates for ungaged locations. In order to estimate
        streamflow at a useful spatial and temporal resolution throughout the nation,
        efficient methods need to be selected. This report examines several methods
        used for streamflow estimation in ungaged basins to determine the best methods
        for regional and national implementation.</p>
    <p>A pilot area in the southeast United States was selected to apply 19 different
        streamflow estimation methods and evaluate each method by a wide set of 
        performance metrics. Most methods were based on statistical transfer of 
        streamflow properties. The sole process-based model was the Precipitation
        Runoff Modeling System (PRMS). Through these comparisons, two methods emerged
        as the most generally competitive streamflow estimation methods: the
        nearest-neighbor implementations of non-linear spatial interpolation using
        flow duration curves (NN-QPPQ) and standardizing logarithms of streamflow
        by monthly means and standard deviations (NN-SMS12L). It was nearly impossible
        to distinguish between these two methods in terms of performance. Furthermore,
        the results suggest that an optimal streamflow estimation method relies on the
        intended application. Some methods are stronger overall, while some methods may
        be better at predicting particular statistics.</p>
    <p>The methods of analysis presented here reflect a possible framework for continued
        analysis and comprehensive multiple-comparisons of PUB methods. Additional
        metrics of comparison can easily be incorporated into this type of analysis.
        By considering such a multi-faceted approach, the top-performing models can
        easily be identified and considered for further research. The top-performing
        models can then provide a basis for future applications and explorations
        by scientists, engineers, managers and practitioners to suit their own needs.</p>
